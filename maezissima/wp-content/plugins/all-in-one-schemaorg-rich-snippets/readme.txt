It always has been one of our major focus. In fact you can say design is our DNA. However, in previous versions on AIOSRS, we felt it was missing somehow.We have received requests for article rich snippets from a huge no. of our users. So, we have added the Article type in this new update.Also, we observed most of the people did not want the MicroData box visible to users but only to search engines and requested the feature. However as this is against Google's guidelines, we gave a though to an alternative. Rather than people using the plugin only for 'displaying rich snippets in search results' and 'comporting on front end design' - why not design the plugin in a way that people would want the plugin for displaying a beautiful post summary and rich snippets would come with that? Wouldn't that be awesome? So with this update, we stared trying the same thing; and with of course with feedbacks from our beloved users, we look forward making it even better.In brief, new things in updated version -* Redesigned Front End* Fully Responsive* Retina Ready* Options Panel to make settings and control front end display* Options Panel to make settings and control strings (Flexibility for admin & also helpful for sites in other languages)* Setting to make images look betterSome of the other non design things -* Better reviews and ratings functionality* 100% MicroData. Rolled out RDFa completely* and many other small but important thingsThanks [Nitin](http://profiles.wordpress.org/yawalkarm/ "Nitin Yawalkar") & Pratik for your major contributions******************** ******************** ******************** Next scheduled version will include - - Even simpler, shorter, typographic and more beautiful design of MicroData box.
